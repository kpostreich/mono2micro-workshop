Mono2Micro semi-automates the refactoring process using AI and can provide a huge acceleration to and significantly economize the task of moving Java monoliths to containers in the cloud. In this hands on workshop you will refactor a small but typical Java EE into deployable microservices via the following steps: monolith code instrumentation generation of runtime traces generation of AI-recommended partitions customization of partitions code generation, and finally the deployment of the partitions as executable microservices in docker containers.

Objectives: Learn how to perform the end-to-end process of using Mono2Micro to analyze a Java EE monolith and transform it to Microservices Learn how to build and run the transformed microservices in containers using Docker and OpenLiberty Activities The lab has three main parts, each having specific learning objectives.
