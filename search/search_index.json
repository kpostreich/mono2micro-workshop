Mono2Micro semi-automates the refactoring process using AI and can provide a huge acceleration to and significantly economize the task of moving Java monoliths to containers in the cloud. In this hands on workshop you will refactor a small but typical Java EE into deployable microservices via the following steps: monolith code instrumentation generation of runtime traces generation of AI-recommended partitions customization of partitions code generation, and finally the deployment of the partitions as executable microservices in docker containers.
