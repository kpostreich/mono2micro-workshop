### Workshop Introduction

Of all the variants of application modernization, refactoring to microservices is the hardest, but when properly
implemented, provides the maximum ROI. 

Mono2Micro semi-automates the refactoring process using AI and can provide a huge acceleration to and 
significantly economize the task of moving Java monoliths to containers in the cloud.


In this hands on workshop you will refactor a small but typical Java EE into deployable microservices 
via the following steps:

 - monolith code instrumentation
 - generation of runtime traces
 - generation of AI-recommended partitions
 - customization of partitions
 - code generation, and finally
 - the deployment of the partitions as executable microservices in docker containers.
